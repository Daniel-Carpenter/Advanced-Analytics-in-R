OLS
================
Daniel Carpenter

## Objectives
* Describe the theory of parameter estimation in ordinary least squares (OLS) regression
* Interpret OLS results
* Recognize common problematic residual patterns and determine strategy to mitigate related issues
* Evaluate residuals based on their influence to the predicted values and model fit
* Diagnose multicollinearity based on variance inflation
* Use dimension reduction model paradigms or penalized regression approaches to address typical weaknesses under OLS
